# OOP_exercises

These are some exercises I did in preparation of the exam of the Object Oriented Programming course.
In every folder there is a file Requirements.html that explain what the exercise is required to do.
In the src folders there are always some test files, these were given from the professors to verify the right functioning of the code.
